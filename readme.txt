Ads EZ Plugin for Google AdSense inserts Google ads on your blog, with customization using color pickers, widget support and robust placement options.

== Description ==

Ads EZ Plugin for Google AdSense provides a streamlined interface to deploy Google ads on your blog. You can customize the colors, sizes and placement of the ad blocks and activate them right from the plugin interface.The admin interface uses a highly functional and modern interface based on the twitter bootstrap framework with generous, context-sensitive help on every single option.

Ads EZ Plugin for Google AdSense is a specialized version of [Google AdSense Ultra](http://buy.thulasidas.com/google-adsense/ "Most versatile AdSense plugin for your blog"), which lets you manage in basic, standard and expert modes, all in a beautifully designed modern interface.

= Features =
1. Tabbed and intuitive interface.
2. Rich display and alignment options.
3. Widgets for your sidebar.
4. Robust codebase and option/object models.
5. Control over the positioning and display of ad blocks in each post or page.
6. Customized Google interface with color pickers.
7. Popover help for every option in the plugin.
8. An interface tour to familiarize yourself with the plugin features and layout.
9. Ability to spawn the plugin interface as a separate tab/window independent of the WordPress admin interface.

= Pro Version =

Ads EZ Plugin for Google AdSense is the freely distributed version of a premium plugin. The [Ultra version](http://buy.thulasidas.com/google-adsense "Pro version of the Ads EZ Plugin for Google AdSense plugin for $9.45") gives you even more features.

1. Safe Content filter: To ensure that your Google AdSense ads show only on those pages that seem to comply with Google AdSense policies, which can be important since some comments may render your pages inconsistent with those policies.
2. IP filter: Ability to specify a list of computers where your ads will not be shown, in order to prevent accidental clicks on your own ads -- one of the main reasons AdSense bans you. These features will minimize your chance of getting banned.
3. Compatibility mode: To solve the issue of the ad insertion messing up your page appearances when using some themes.
5. Category/Post Control: Ability to suppress ads on specific categories, posts and pages.
5. Shortcode Support: Show the ads only on the pages or posts you want, and exactly where you want them.
6. Mobile Support: Ability to show different sets of ads on mobile devices, or to suppress ads.
7. Excerpts: Ability to show a configurable number of ads on Excerpts (which make up the home page in some themes).
8. Option Sets: Multiple option sets can be defined and easily switched between.
9. Suspend Ads: Ability to temporarily suppress ad serving.
10. Admin Interface Themes: Multiple color schemes for the admin interface.
11. Ad Serving Statistics: Keep an eye on your ad serving statistics to make sure that Google is not shortchanging you. (Optional paid module)
12. Basic/Expert Modes: You can choose to operate it in basic or expert modes in addition to the standard mode.

The Ultra version costs $9.45 and can be [purchased online](http://buy.thulasidas.com/google-adsense/ "Pro version of the Ads EZ Plugin for Google AdSense plugin for $9.45") with instant download link.

== Installation ==

The easiest way to install this plugin is to use the WordPress Admin interface. Go to your admin dashboard, find the "Plugins" menu, and click on "Add New". Find this plugin and click on "Install Now" and follow the WordPress instructions.

If you want to download it and manually install, you can again use the WordPress dashboard interface. First download the plugin zip file to your local computer. Then go to your admin dashboard, find the "Plugins" menu, and click on "Add New". After clicking on the "Add New" menu item as above, click on "Upload" (below the title "Install Plugins" near the top). Browse for your downloaded zip file, upload it and activate the plugin.

Further updates (and Pro upgrades and module installations) to the plugin can be done easily from the plugin admin page itself, by clicking on the Updates button on the top right corner.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I control the appearance of the ad blocks using CSS? =

All `<div>`s that Ads EZ Plugin for Google AdSense creates have the class attribute `adsense`. Furthermore, they have class attributes like `adsense-top`, `adsense-bottom` etc., You can set the style for these classes in your theme `style.css` to control their appearance.

= Can I control how the ad blocks are formatted in each page? =

Yes! In Ads EZ Plugin for Google AdSense, you have more options [through **custom fields**] to control ad blocks in individual posts/pages. Add custom fields with keys like **adsense-top, adsense-middle, adsense-bottom** and with values like **left, right, center** or **no** to have control how the ad blocks show up in each post or page. The value "**no**" suppresses all the ad blocks in the post or page for that provider.

= I don't understand the Pro features. Porn and site block - can't you set those during Asdense ad setup? =

What you have in AdSense is an ability to block ads from certain sites. For instance, if you don't like ads *from* my site "thulasidas.com", you can block them. What the pro version gives you is the ability to block ads *to* certain clients. That is, if you don't want visitors from certain IP addresses see your ads (because they may click on too many of them, getting your AdSense account banned, for instance), you can with my plugin.

Porn block also is similar -- Google lets you choose non-porn ads (I think). What my plugin does is to look at the content of your page, and block ads if it looks like a porn page. (This can happen if a spammer posts a porn kind of comment on your blog, which again may get your AdSense account banned.)

= How do I report a bug or ask a question? =

Please report any problems, and share your thoughts and comments [at the plugin forum at WordPress](http://wordpress.org/tags/google-adsense-lite "Post comments/suggestions/bugs on the WordPress.org forum. [Requires login/registration]") Or [contact me](http://support.thulasidas.com/ "Contact Manoj").

**If you have a question or comment about the Pro version, please do not use the forum hosted at WordPress.org, but [contact the plugin author](http://support.thulasidas.com/ "Contact Manoj") using our support portal.**

= Can I go back to the previous version of the plugin? I don't like the modern bootstrap/AJAX interface. =

You can download the [previous version](https://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/google-adsense-lite.2.50.zip "Last version before the fancy AJAX interface") and install it. First deactivate and delete the latest version of the plugin, and then follow upload method under the *Installation* section of this document. The new version uses an completely different options model, and your old options are left intact in your database.
